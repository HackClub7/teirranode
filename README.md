# TIERRANODE: A DECENTRALIZED LAND REGISTRY PLATFORM

## ðŸš€ Motivation
Land ownership in Nigeria, particularly in Plateau State, is plagued by:
- **Fraudulent sales** and **land grabbing.**
- **Double issuance** of certificates leading to conflicting ownership claims.
- **Lack of transparency** and accessible records.
- **Inefficiencies** in manual, bureaucratic land transaction processes.

Tierranode is motivated by the need to address these challenges. With **60% of court cases in Nigeria linked to land disputes**, Tierranode offers a **decentralized, transparent, and efficient solution** to mitigate fraud, streamline transactions, and foster trust in land ownership systems.

## ðŸŒŸ Solution
Tierranode leverages **Starknet** and **Calimero** to create a **privacy-centric decentralized platform** for managing land ownership, ensuring:
1. **Transparency** through immutable blockchain-based records.
2. **Security** via escrow-enabled smart contracts.
3. **Efficiency** in automated and dispute-free transactions.

### **Key Features**
- **Blockchain-Based Registration**  
  Land details are registered on Starknet using Cairo smart contracts, ensuring data authenticity and immutability.
  
- **NFT Minting for Land**  
  Each land parcel is represented as an NFT, serving as proof of ownership and enabling seamless transfer.

- **Partial and Full Sales**  
  Landowners can sell entire plots or fractions of their land, with proportional NFT transfers.

- **Ownership Transfer History**  
  A detailed, immutable history of ownership, sales, and land appreciation is maintained on-chain.

- **Real-Time Land Valuation**  
  Smart contracts dynamically update valuations based on sales history and market conditions.

- **Privacy-Centric Data Storage**  
  Sensitive documents (e.g., title deeds) are securely encrypted and stored using Calimero.

## ðŸŽ¯ Benefits
1. **Increased Transparency:** Public, tamper-proof records build trust among parties.  
2. **Enhanced Security:** Escrow-based transactions mitigate fraud risks.  
3. **Efficient Processes:** Automation reduces delays and costs associated with manual bureaucracy.  
4. **Immutable Records:** Permanent blockchain storage ensures reliable ownership data.  
5. **Economic Growth:** A transparent system boosts confidence in real estate markets.
